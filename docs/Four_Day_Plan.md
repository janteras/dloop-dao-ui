# AssetDAO Remediation: Four-Day Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive four-day plan to fully remediate the AssetDAO implementation, addressing UI inconsistencies, fixing bugs, removing mock data, and ensuring proper integration with smart contracts through the unified Ethers-to-Wagmi migration pattern.

## Current Issues

1. **UI Inconsistencies**: The UnifiedProposalCard doesn't match the design of the original ProposalCard
2. **Amount Display Bug**: Amount is displaying as 0.00 on the AssetDAO Proposal Card UI
3. **Token Display Bug**: Token is displaying as 0x0000...0000 instead of proper token symbols
4. **Proposal Type Bug**: All proposals (both invest and divest) are displayed as Investment Proposals
5. **Description Missing**: Proposal description is missing from Proposal Cards
6. **Mock Data Dependencies**: Reliance on mock data causing maintenance challenges

## Day 1: Analysis and UI Migration

### Morning: Analysis and Planning

1. **End-to-End Analysis of AssetDAO Flow**
   - Map the data flow from smart contract to UI components
   - Identify all integration points and potential failure points
   - Document current state of Ethers-to-Wagmi migration for AssetDAO
   - Review hooks, services and API integration

2. **Review Documentation**
   - Review `dloop-ui/attached_assets/AssetDAO.md`
   - Review `dloop-ui/attached_assets/DEVELOPER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_UPDATED.md`
   - Study the concept in `dloop-ui/docs/d-loop-whitepaper.md`
   - Analyze recent fixes documented in `dloop-ui/client/src/ASSET_DAO_FIXES.md`

### Afternoon: UI Migration

1. **Copy UI Design from ProposalCard to UnifiedProposalCard**
   - Transfer visual styling while preserving unified implementation functionality
   - Ensure proper implementation of feature flags
   - Implement address truncation with copy functionality
   - Add countdown timer for active proposals
   - Maintain responsive design for different screen sizes

2. **Set up Testing Environment**
   - Configure local development environment for testing
   - Ensure access to test contracts on testnets
   - Create testing checklist for identified bugs

**Day 1 Deliverables:**
- Updated UnifiedProposalCard with consistent UI design
- Documentation of complete AssetDAO data flow
- Bug testing environment and checklist

## Day 2: Contract Integration and Bug Fixes - Part 1

### Morning: Contract and ABI Review

1. **Review Contract Integration**
   - Analyze `dloop-dao-ui-vi/assetdao_abi_full.json`
   - Review `dloop-ui/scripts/fetch-abis.js`
   - Check for ABI discrepancies with deployed contracts
   - Verify contract function signatures against implementations

2. **Analyze Token Symbol Resolution**
   - Review token symbol resolution mechanism
   - Identify root cause of token display issues
   - Create improved token mapping implementation

### Afternoon: Bug Fixes

1. **Fix Token Display Issues**
   - Implement robust token symbol resolution
   - Add fallback mechanisms for unknown tokens
   - Ensure consistent token symbol display across all views
   - Add caching for token symbols to improve performance

2. **Fix Amount Formatting**
   - Implement proper decimal handling for token amounts
   - Ensure amounts are correctly parsed from contract data
   - Add proper numeric formatting with localization support
   - Prevent "0.00" display by implementing proper fallbacks

**Day 2 Deliverables:**
- Fixed token symbol display in proposal cards
- Fixed amount formatting in proposal cards
- Documentation of contract integration and token resolution

## Day 3: Bug Fixes - Part 2 and Mock Data Removal

### Morning: Remaining Bug Fixes

1. **Fix Proposal Type Display**
   - Implement correct mapping of contract proposal types to UI representation
   - Ensure "Divest" proposals are properly displayed
   - Add visual differentiation between invest and divest proposals
   - Fix type-related conditional rendering

2. **Fix Description Display**
   - Ensure proposal descriptions are properly displayed
   - Implement truncation for long descriptions
   - Add expand/collapse functionality for long descriptions
   - Ensure proper handling of HTML/markdown in descriptions

### Afternoon: Mock Data Management

1. **Review Current Mock Implementation**
   - Analyze current mock data implementation
   - Document dependencies on mock data
   - Create migration plan for removing mock data

2. **Implement Production-Ready Data Fetching**
   - Enhance API utilities to properly handle errors
   - Implement proper caching for API responses
   - Create development-only mock provider pattern
   - Ensure seamless transition between development and production

**Day 3 Deliverables:**
- Fixed proposal type display
- Fixed description display
- Plan for mock data removal
- Enhanced API utilities

## Day 4: Testing, Documentation, and Deployment

### Morning: End-to-End Testing

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test all fixed bugs across different environments
   - Verify proper contract integration
   - Test with multiple wallet providers
   - Verify proper error handling

2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with malformed contract data
   - Test with different token types
   - Test with extreme values (very large/small amounts)
   - Test network disconnection scenarios

### Afternoon: Documentation and Deployment

1. **Update Documentation**
   - Update `ASSET_DAO_FIXES.md` with all implemented fixes
   - Create developer guide for AssetDAO integration
   - Document known limitations and future improvements
   - Update component documentation

2. **Deployment Planning**
   - Create deployment checklist
   - Document rollback procedures
   - Create monitoring plan for post-deployment
   - Prepare communication for stakeholders

**Day 4 Deliverables:**
- Fully tested AssetDAO implementation
- Comprehensive documentation updates
- Deployment plan
- Final report on implementation changes

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All identified bugs are fixed and verified in testing
2. The UnifiedProposalCard matches the design of the original ProposalCard
3. Mock data dependencies are properly managed
4. The solution is documented and maintainable
5. The implementation follows the unified contract access pattern
6. All tests pass in development and staging environments

## Monitoring and Maintenance

After implementation, we will:

1. Monitor error rates in production
2. Collect user feedback on the implementation
3. Identify any remaining edge cases
4. Plan for future enhancements based on feedback

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Performance optimizations for token resolution
2. Enhanced error handling for contract interactions
3. Improved visual feedback during loading states
4. Advanced filtering and sorting of proposals
5. Integration with notification systems for proposal status changes
