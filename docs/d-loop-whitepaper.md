Conclusion  30 Introduction 

D-Loop is a decentralized protocol and DAO designed to create and manage D-AI , a fully collateralized asset-backed currency, through AI-optimized DAO governance. 

D-AI operates as a stable Digital Currency and a direct claim on the collateral pool, enabling seamless transactions and redeemability. 

By integrating AI-powered nodes with decentralized governance, the protocol ensures continuous stabilization and optimization of D-AI’s underlying asset pool. At its core, D-AI functions as: 

● A stable medium of exchange, backed 1:1 by transparent reserves (USDC, WBTC, PAXG, EURT) 

● A TokenShare representing direct ownership in the collateral pool 

● A self-governing monetary instrument powered by decentralized decision-making 

The protocol achieves this through its unique dual-layer architecture: 

1.  AI Automation : Continuous portfolio optimization through AI-powered nodes that analyze and execute invest/divest proposals 

2.  Community Governance : Decentralized voting mechanisms that ensure transparent oversight and alignment with holder interests 

By merging these elements, D-Loop creates a next-generation currency system that maintains price stability while adapting to market conditions - offering users the confidence of traditional asset-backed currencies with the innovation of decentralized finance. Initially, D-Loop will deploy two types of AI-powered nodes: 

1.  Governance Nodes – Autonomous agents that propose and vote on asset rebalancing (invest/divest) to maintain D-AI’s stability and redeemability. 

2.  Investment Nodes – Execute real-time portfolio adjustments, ensuring the currency’s value is always backed 1:1 by transparent reserves. 

D-Loop introduces two new assets to the Hedera and Ethereum blockchains: 

● DLOOP – An ERC-223 or HTS governance token used for invest/divest proposals and other key voting mechanisms within the DAO. DLOOP holders earn merit-based rewards based on their historical voting performance, incentivizing informed decision-making. 

● D-AI – The D-Loop Asset Index token, is a stable, redeemable asset-backed currency that combines the stability of a reserve-backed monetary instrument with the flexibility of a TokenShare and transactional utility. 

The DAO has two main components: 

1.  Treasury DAO – Responsible for governing investing/divesting decisions 

2.  Protocol DAO – Responsible for community-controlled protocol governance 

DLOOP token holders are incentivized to delegate their tokens to Governance Nodes , allowing AI-driven decision-making to optimize Treasury Reserve management within the DAO. This delegation mechanism helps ensure active participation and efficient governance while rewarding holders based on their contributions. 

Regulated entities can participate in D-Loop’s ecosystem in two ways: 

1.  Investment Nodes – Institutions may deposit funds into these AI-powered nodes, which autonomously execute investment strategies within the DAO. 

2.  Direct DAO Participation – Entities can engage directly by submitting invest/divest proposals , shaping the asset index through decentralized governance. 

This structure encourages a seamless integration of AI automation, decentralized governance, and institutional investment. 

The D-Loop protocol functions similarly to a real-world asset index, ensuring stability and efficiency through its AI-driven governance model. All TokenShares, represented as D-AI tokens , are fully backed basketcoins , secured by a diversified pool of assets locked as collateral within the DAO’s treasury. This backing ensures the tangible value of D-AI while maintaining a transparent and verifiable reserve. 

Governance Nodes use machine learning to analyze market data, ensuring proposals align with D-AI’s stability goals. By leveraging AI-powered decision-making, D-Loop optimizes asset pool performance, dynamically adjusting allocations to maximize returns and reduce risk. The protocol employs AI-driven rebalancing to maintain D-AI’s stability as a currency, automatically adjusting asset weights (e.g., USDC, WBTC, PAXG, EURT ) via invest/divest proposals. This minimizes volatility risks while preserving capital efficiency and redeemability guarantees. .

# D-AI Digital Currency 

D-AI is D-Loop’s asset-backed currency – a stable, redeemable digital asset that merges the reliability of traditional reserve-backed money with the innovation of decentralized finance. 

Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, D-AI’s 1:1 collateralization and AI-driven rebalancing eliminate volatility risks while enabling decentralized governance. 

Each D-AI token represents: 

● A Stable Medium of Exchange 

○ Fully collateralized 1:1 by transparent reserves (USDC, WBTC, PAXG, EURT) 

○ Enables seamless, low-volatility transactions 

● A TokenShare with Utility 

○ Grants direct ownership in the DAO’s reserve pool 

○ Supports three core financial functions: 

■ Stable exchanges : Trade with price predictability 

■ Volatility hedging : Mitigate crypto market risks 

■ Portfolio exposure : Access a dynamically optimized basket of high-liquidity assets 

This dual design ensures D-AI operates as both a practical currency and a capital-efficient investment vehicle, governed by AI-driven optimization and decentralized voting. 

# Treasury DAO Specifications 

D-Loop’s asset pool is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), represented by a smart contract on the Ethereum and Hedera blockchains. The DAO is responsible for holding the asset pool’s reserves, processing voting proposals, and executing governance decisions in a fully transparent and autonomous manner. Bootstrapping Mechanism 

The Treasury DAO is initialized via a Bootstrapping Proposal, where founding members or AI Governance Nodes propose the first supported assets (e.g., USDC, WBTC) and mint the initial D-AI index tokens. This proposal requires 

● A minimum quorum of token holder votes. 

● Price oracle integrations for all proposed assets. 

● Smart contract logic to mint the initial D-AI tokens 1:1 against deposited collateral. 

Treasury DAO Operations 

The Treasury DAO maintains an internal price for D-AI tokens, calculated as: 

## D-AI Price = Total D-AI Tokens Minted / 

## ∑(Supported Asset Quantities×Oracle Prices) 

This price is used for: 

● Minting/burning D-AI tokens without oracle dependencies. 

● Auditing reserve balances. 

# Protocol DAO Specifications 

The Protocol DAO is responsible for specific governance decisions around protocol upgrades, asset support, and platform parameters. It processes voting proposals, executes governance decisions, and ensures the platform remains adaptable to evolving market conditions. 

Key Decisions: 

1.  Adding New Assets : Proposing and approving new assets to be supported by the platform. 

2.  Smart Contract Upgrades : Voting on upgrades to improve security, efficiency, or functionality. 

3.  Parameter Adjustments : Modifying platform parameters, such as reward distribution rates or fee structures. 

Key Features 

1.  Self-Executing Proposals :○ Once a proposal passes a quorum of 51%, it is automatically executed by the smart contract. 

○ No manual intervention is required, ensuring transparency and efficiency. 

2.  Reduced Feature Set :

○ Focuses on three core decisions :

1.  Adding New Assets : Proposing and approving new assets to be supported by the platform. 

2.  Smart Contract Upgrades : Voting on upgrades to improve security, efficiency, or functionality. 

3.  Parameter Adjustments : Modifying specific platform parameters (e.g., reward distribution rates, fee structures). 

3.  Reputation-Based Proposals :

○ Anyone can submit a proposal 

○ Only high-reputation proposers can submit reward generating proposals 

○ Rewards are issued only if the proposal is submitted by a high-reputation proposer and passes the vote. 

4.  Simplified Voting :

○ Voting is binary: YES or NO .

○ Proposals require a quorum and a majority vote to pass. 

Proposal Structure 

Each proposal includes the following details: 

● Proposed By : The address of the proposer (must have a high reputation score). 

● Details : The address or hash of the proposal details (e.g., smart contract address, asset details). 

● Description : A brief description of the proposal (e.g., "Add the BASE token"). 

● Vote : A binary YES/NO vote. 

The Protocol DAO is designed to ensure the platform remains secure, adaptable, and aligned with community interests. By leveraging AI-operated governance nodes and linear reward distribution, the DAO encourages active participation by AIs and Community members alike to ensure active participation and high-quality decision-making. D-AI Token and Asset Pool Mechanics 

D-AI tokens function as both a transactional currency and a store of value, backed 1:1 by the DAO’s reserve assets . These ERC-223 tokens or HTS tokens in the case of the Hedera blockchain, are minted only when investment proposals are approved by the DAO. 

The smart contract ensures that only the DAO has permission to mint new D-AI tokens, reinforcing a strict supply-control mechanism. 

The asset pool guarantees instant redemptions at par value , enabling holders to exchange D-AI tokens 1:1 for their share of the reserve assets (USDC, WBTC, PAXG, EURT), ensuring stability akin to traditional currencies. 

This mechanism guarantees that D-AI remains fully backed by tangible reserves, ensuring verifiable value preservation and stability. 

Example Calculation: 

● Total D-AI Supply: 1,000 tokens 

● Asset Pool Reserves: 

○ 10,000 USDC ($10,000) 

○ 0.5 WBTC ($10,000) 

○ 5 PAXG ($10,000) 

○ Total Pool Value: $30,000 

● D-AI Price per Token: $30 

This model ensures strict 1:1 collateralization, eliminating inflationary risks while enabling transparent, trustless redemptions via the DAO’s smart contracts 

# Governance Mechanisms 

D-Loop employs a decentralized governance model, where DLOOP tokens serve as voting tokens for protocol proposals. Governance operates through a quorum-based, snapshot voting system, ensuring transparency and security. Token holders can delegate their voting rights to AI-powered Governance Nodes , preventing voter apathy and improving participation. 

AI-Driven Governance: The Role of AI Voting Agents AI Voting Agents are autonomous nodes that analyze market data to optimize governance decisions, ensuring proactive treasury reserve management. 

What sets D-Loop apart is the integration of AI Voting Agents —autonomous AI-driven participants that optimize invest/divest decisions while complementing human governance. These agents analyze market conditions, execute data-driven voting strategies, and enhance decision-making efficiency. 

By leveraging AI, D-Loop ensures: 

● Continuous asset pool optimization through dynamic rebalancing 

● Reduced governance inefficiencies by mitigating inactive voting 

● AI-human synergy , where AI handles routine decision-making while human voters engage in higher-level governance 

Proposal and Voting Process 

1. Submitting Proposals 

● Any DLOOP holder can submit a proposal to modify the asset pool (e.g., add/remove assets). 

● Proposals specify: 

○ Proposal type (e.g., invest or divest) 

○ Asset amount requested 

○ D-AI token payout or exchange rate 

● A deposit is required upon submission to prevent spam. The deposit is refunded upon execution or expiration of the proposal. 

2. Voting Process 

● Voting is conducted via a token-based voting system , where each DLOOP token represents one vote .

● Delegated voting allows token holders to assign their voting power to AI Governance Nodes for automated decision-making. 

● Governance Token holders can vote "Yes" or "No" , and their vote weight is proportional to their DLOOP holdings. 

● Snapshot voting ensures fairness by using token balances at “proposal block - 1” ,preventing flash loan attacks or vote manipulation .

3. Passing and Executing Proposals 

● For a proposal to pass, it must meet two conditions: 

○ A quorum threshold (e.g., 30% of the total DLOOP supply must vote) 

○ More “Yes” votes than “No” votes after the voting deadline ● Governance Token holders can change or cancel their vote anytime before the deadline. 

● Passed proposals enter a cooldown period before execution, allowing dissenting token holders to exit the system if necessary. 

● The proposal submitter executes the transaction , triggering the DAO to process payments and asset transfers. 

● Time limits prevent indefinite proposal execution; expired proposals are voided. 

Governance Flexibility & Evolution 

Governance parameters, including quorum thresholds, voting deadlines, execution delays, and proposal expiration times, can be adjusted through governance proposals, ensuring that D-Loop remains adaptable as it evolves. 

This AI-powered governance model ensures efficient, decentralized, and transparent decision-making, merging human oversight with autonomous AI optimization to create a next-generation Treasury DAO. 

# Delegated Voting: AI and Human Governance 

D-Loop’s delegated voting system allows DLOOP Governance Token holders to assign their voting rights to other participants, ensuring active governance and informed decision-making. This feature benefits holders who want to participate in governance without directly voting on every proposal. 

Delegation Options 

DLOOP holders can delegate their voting rights to: 

1.  Other DLOOP token holders – Experienced members who actively participate in governance. 

2.  AI Voting Agents – Autonomous AI-powered decision-makers that optimize voting strategies based on market data and historical governance performance. The D-Loop UI clearly distinguishes AI Voting Agents from human delegates , helping token holders make informed delegation decisions. 

Key Benefits of Delegated Voting 

● Prevents voter apathy – Ensures that proposals reach quorum thresholds, even if some holders remain inactive. 

● Encourages expert-led decision-making – Supports the rise of "Asset Pool Managers" , individuals or specialist AI who research proposals in depth and vote on behalf of delegators. 

● Enhances governance efficiency – By combining human oversight with AI-powered automation, D-Loop ensures a balanced and optimized governance process .

# Asset Addition (Invest) Proposals 

An Asset Addition (Invest) proposal allows the DAO to acquire a digital asset in exchange for newly minted D-AI tokens. The asset must conform to one of the supported Ethereum token standards, which include both fungible and non-fungible tokens, such as ERC-20, ERC-223, and ERC-721. 

Process: 

1.  A proposal is submitted specifying the asset type and quantity to be acquired. 

2.  If the proposal passes voting, the executor of the proposal sends the asset to the DAO’s smart contract. 

3.  The received asset is secured within the DAO’s treasury. 

4.  The DAO mints new D-AI tokens equivalent to the asset’s value and transfers them to the executor of the proposal. 

This mechanism expands the DAO’s asset pool while ensuring that newly issued D-AI tokens are fully backed by real assets. 

# Asset Removal (Divest) Proposals 

An Asset Removal (Divest) proposal enables the DAO to release a digital asset in exchange for D-AI tokens , effectively removing the asset from the DAO’s treasury. 

Process: 1.  A proposal is submitted specifying the asset type and quantity to be withdrawn. 

2.  If the proposal passes voting, the executor sends the required D-AI tokens to the DAO. 

3.  The DAO burns the received D-AI tokens, reducing the circulating supply. 

4.  The DAO releases the requested asset to the executor of the proposal. 

This divestment mechanism ensures that asset allocations remain balanced while maintaining the intrinsic value of D-AI tokens within the ecosystem. 

# DLOOP Token Rewards System 

The DLOOP Token Rewards System incentivizes governance participation by rewarding token holders based on the profitability of their votes on investment (invest/divest) proposals. Rewards are calculated using Chainlink Price Oracles , which track real-time market prices for all supported assets, ensuring accurate and reliable price data for reward calculations. 

Reward Conditions 

Rewards are distributed based on the outcome of user decisions within a defined epoch (30-day period). The conditions for earning rewards are as follows: 

1.  Invest Decisions :

○ Yes Vote : If the price of the asset increases after an "Invest Yes" vote, the user is rewarded for generating profit. 

○ No Vote : If the price of the asset decreases after an "Invest No" vote, the user is rewarded for avoiding loss. 

2.  Divest Decisions :

○ No Vote : If the price of the asset increases after a "Divest No" vote, the user is rewarded for preserving profit. 

○ Yes Vote : If the price of the asset decreases after a "Divest Yes" vote, the user is rewarded for avoiding further loss. 

3.  No Change : If the price of the asset remains unchanged, no rewards are issued. 

Reward Distribution 

A total of 20,016,000 DLOOP tokens (~20% of the total supply) are allocated for governance rewards. These tokens are distributed linearly over a period of 2160 days (6 years) , with 

278,000 DLOOP tokens issued per epoch (30 day peroid) .Rewards are distributed proportionally to users based on their contribution to correct decisions. The formula for calculating a user's reward is: 

Where: 

● User Correct Decisions : The number of correct decisions made by the user in the current epoch. 

● Total Correct Decisions : The total number of correct decisions made by all users in the current epoch. 

● Epoch Reward Pool : 278,000 DLOOP tokens. 

Example Rewards Scenarios 

Invest Yes Vote on WBTC: 

● A user votes "Yes" to invest in WBTC. 

● WBTC price increases by 10% within the defined epoch. 

● The user is rewarded with DLOOP tokens for generating profit. 

Invest No Vote on PAXG: 

● A user votes "No" to invest in PAXG. 

● PAXG price decreases by 5% within the defined epoch. 

● The user is rewarded with DLOOP tokens for avoiding loss. 

Divest No Vote on WBTC: 

● A user votes "No" to divest from WBTC. 

● WBTC price increases by 8% within the defined epoch. 

● The user is rewarded with DLOOP tokens for preserving profit. 

Divest Yes Vote on PAXG: 

● A user votes "Yes" to divest from PAXG. 

● PAXG price decreases by 3% within the defined epoch. 

● The user is rewarded with DLOOP tokens for avoiding further loss. The DLOOP Token Rewards System is designed to align incentives and produce high-quality governance decisions. By rewarding users for decisions that generate profit or prevent loss, the system ensures active and thoughtful participation in the governance process. The use of Price Oracles, combined with a linear distribution model and proportional reward calculation, makes the system transparent and sustainable over the long term. 

# DLOOP Cross-Chain Interoperability 

For cross-chain interoperability, DLOOP utilizes HashPort's non-custodial bridge, enabling 

seamless transfers between Hedera and Ethereum networks. See  HashPort Portal  for technical 

details. 

Process Flow :

1.  Locking : Users deposit DLOOP tokens into Hedera's bridge smart contract, triggering a cryptographic proof. 

2.  Minting : The proof verifies on Ethereum, minting 1:1 wrapped DLOOP (wDLOOP) ERC-20 tokens. 

3.  Redemption : Burning wDLOOP on Ethereum releases native DLOOP on Hedera. 

# Governance Nodes: Technical Overview 

# Core Functionality 

D-Loop’s AI Governance Nodes act as a decentralized central bank, continuously optimizing D-AI’s reserves in real-time. By analyzing macroeconomic signals, these nodes propose and execute rebalancing strategies. This ensures that D-AI remains a stable, adaptive Digital Currency for global use . Key functions include: 

● Proposal Analysis : Evaluate invest/divest proposals using market data, historical trends, and risk assessments. 

● Voting : Cast votes aligned with optimization criteria (e.g., maximizing returns, minimizing risk). 

● Quorum Assurance : Ensure active governance during low voter engagement. 

● Rewards : Earn merit-based rewards for accurate and profitable decisions. Smart Contracts 

DLOOP leverages non-transferable, soulbound NFTs to uniquely identify AI Governance Nodes, ensuring decentralized and tamper-proof access to privileged governance functions. Each AI node is issued a permanent, non-tradable NFT that grants: 

● Faster voting periods (e.g., 1 day vs. 7 days for humans). 

● Higher quorum requirements (e.g., 40% vs. 30%). 

● Cross-DAO privileges (consistent rules in ProtocolDAO, Treasury DAO, and future modules). 

Key Advantages 

○ Verifiable Legitimacy : On-chain NFT ownership provides cryptographic proof of AI node status 

○ Cross-Chain Interoperability : Single NFT verification works across Ethereum and Hedera networks 

○ Attack Resistance : Non-transferable NFTs prevent privilege trading or Sybil attacks

decentralized infrastructure to enable efficient, data-driven governance. By leveraging EigenLayer and Python, these nodes ensure transparency, security, and scalability, positioning D-Loop as a leader in AI-powered decentralized finance. 

# D-AI DAO Token Modeling 

This section summarizes the portfolio theory and outlines the process for determining and updating the value of the DAO’s investment pool. The value of the portfolio is dynamic and influenced by the changing values of the various assets it holds, making it a time-varying function. Portfolio Value and Asset Variations 

The portfolio’s value evolves over time due to fluctuations in asset prices  ,

and it is a time varying function. 

(1) 

The portfolio's value (1) changes as consequence of assets' prices variations 

(2) 

Estimated returns are defined as follows: 

(3) 

where  and  .

Since the variations in prices of assets are stochastic, one can consider statistical mean value and variance of estimated returns: 

(4) 

(5) 

The weights  can be calculated introducing a Lagrangian function F:

(6) Optimal weights  can be calculated by setting the partial derivatives of (6) with respect to 

, and  to zero and solving the linear system of (n+2) equations. 

Investment Nodes and Token Modeling 

The investment nodes play a central role in the d-loop DAO's token modeling. These nodes are responsible for the automated execution of investment and divestment proposals, ensuring that the assets in the portfolio are actively managed to achieve steady growth and stability .

Individuals can join the investment pool by exchanging any crypto asset for the mTokens (D-AI tokens) representing shares in the asset pool. These tokens are designed to reflect the value of the underlying portfolio and allow token holders to participate in governance and reward mechanisms. 

The value of the portfolio at any given time is directly tied to the performance of the assets in the pool. The price of the D-AI token corresponds to its intrinsic value, which is calculated by the following equation: 

(7) 

Initialization of (7) is at some extent arbitrary and depends on initial number of tokens issued 

and chosen price  .

Governance of the Investment Pool 

The DAO Governance Token holders control the investment decisions through voting on proposals. Each proposal requires a majority vote to either invest (acquire new assets) or divest (sell assets). The governance model allows for active participation in the decision-making process, ensuring that only sound and profitable decisions are executed. ● Investment Proposals: Involves purchasing a specified quantity of a digital asset in exchange for a share of the asset pool. 

● Divestment Proposals: Involves selling a specified quantity of an asset held in the pool, and returning a share of the pool to the investor. 

Whenever new DAO tokens are issued or burned, the portfolio must be rebalanced according to the following equation: 

(8) 

Where  and 

Decision-Making Process 

The decision-making process, supported by mathematical models , helps identify the optimal choices and in the d-loop DAO, this approach is complemented by AI-powered investment nodes that analyze and execute investment decisions using data-driven models. The collaboration of human expertise and AI-driven optimization ensures that the investment pool is managed effectively, achieving optimal outcomes while maintaining the principles of decentralized governance. 

The D-AI DAO Token Modeling framework is designed to combine mathematical optimization, AI-driven decision-making, and human optimized yield to ensure effective governance and steady growth of the DAO’s investment pool. This process ensures that the DAO’s assets are continuously optimized, while providing opportunities for token holders to participate in governance decisions and earn rewards based on the success of those decisions. 

# AI Agents in d-loop Protocol 

The d-loop protocol integrates AI agents, deployable on EigenLayer nodes on the Ethereum Network (with a separate model for Hedera ), to enhance governance efficiency and facilitate institutional participation. These agents are divided into two types: Governance Nodes and 

Investment Nodes .

Governance Nodes AI Governance Nodes autonomously participate in the DAO’s governance by voting on 

Invest/Divest proposals . These agents complement human voters by analyzing market conditions and proposal contexts to make data-driven decisions. Governance nodes are incentivized with merit-based rewards, maintaining active governance even during periods of low human voter engagement. 

Benefits :

● Increased participation in governance, helping achieve quorum. 

● Data-driven decision-making ensures consistency and accuracy. 

● Reduces voter apathy during low engagement periods. 

Investment Nodes 

Investment Nodes facilitate institutional access to D-AI tokens by automating the investment and divestment processes. Institutional investors can indirectly engage with the DAO after completing KYC/AML procedures through DLOOP Ventures . These nodes manage 

Invest/Divest proposals and execute transactions on behalf of clients without requiring direct governance participation. 

Use Case : An institutional investor places an order for 5,000 D-AI tokens via a broker’s API. The AI Investment Node processes the order, creating and executing the corresponding invest/divest proposals (e.g., buying 5 WBTC, 2000 PAXG ). After DAO approval, the tokens are transferred back to the broker, completing the transaction. 

Benefits :

● Seamless, compliance-friendly access to decentralized assets. 

● Scalable, automated treasury management .

● Enables institutions to engage in DeFi without direct interaction with the DAO. 

Incentives for Deploying AI Agents 

Operators who deploy AI Voting Nodes or Investment Nodes on EigenLayer are rewarded with DLOOP tokens . This ensures a decentralized, automated system for governance and Treasury Reserve management. 

# Technical Overview of EigenLayer Architecture for AI Agents 

The d-loop protocol leverages EigenLayer’s decentralized infrastructure to deploy AI agent modules for enhanced governance and operational capabilities. These agents run as Python-based scripts on EigenLayer nodes, benefiting from EigenLayer’s secure, modular environment. 

Governance Node AI Agents 

Purpose : Governance Nodes autonomously vote on Invest/Divest proposals , complementing human voters. They contribute to quorum achievement and improve decision-making efficiency. 

Architecture :

● AI Model Deployment : Each Governance Node is a Python module running on an 

EigenLayer node , analyzing proposal data, historical market trends, and potential outcomes to cast informed votes. 

● Smart Contract Interaction : The agent interacts with d-loop’s smart contracts using 

Ethereum RPC calls to fetch proposals and submit votes. 

● Reward Mechanism : AI Governance Nodes are rewarded based on voting performance, using the same merit-based reward logic as human voters. 

● Security : Cryptographic signatures authenticate the nodes on EigenLayer , ensuring secure and auditable voting. 

Key Components :

● Python-based decision-making algorithm 

● Interaction with smart contracts via Web3.py 

● Data ingestion (market and proposal data) 

● EigenLayer’s secure node execution 

Investment Nodes 

Purpose : Investment Nodes automate institutional interactions with the d-loop DAO by executing Invest/Divest proposals for institutional clients that have completed KYC/AML 

checks through DLOOP Ventures. 

Architecture :

● KYC/AML Compliance : Before executing any orders, the Investment Node verifies institutional investor compliance through a secure API, ensuring only authorized access to the D-AI token. 

● Order Processing : Upon receiving an order (e.g., 5,000 D-AI tokens), the node determines the necessary crypto purchases (e.g., 5 WBTC, 2,000 PAXG) and submits the required proposals to the DAO for approval. 

● Transaction Execution : After the DAO votes on the proposal, the AI Investment Node finalizes the transaction, distributing the tokens to the institutional investor via the broker API. Key Components :

● KYC/AML verification module 

● Python-based order execution logic 

● Interaction with d-loop smart contracts 

● EigenLayer’s decentralized execution and security layer 

EigenLayer Execution Environment 

● Modularity and Flexibility : Both Governance and Investment Nodes are executed on 

EigenLayer’s modular platform, providing a flexible runtime environment for Python-based decentralized applications (dApps). 

● Security and Decentralization : EigenLayer utilizes slashing conditions and staking mechanisms to ensure nodes comply with protocol rules. Malicious or faulty node behavior results in penalties, enhancing the reliability of the system. 

● Scalability : The system can scale with demand, allowing multiple AI agents to run concurrently across separate nodes, ensuring parallel processing and preventing bottlenecks. 

This integration of AI agents and decentralized infrastructure on EigenLayer optimizes governance, increases institutional accessibility, and ensures the stability and scalability of the d-loop protocol. 

# Institutional Participation 

Institutions gain exposure to a dynamically optimized reserve pool without managing assets directly, reducing operational overhead. 

D-Loop’s AI Investment Nodes are designed to facilitate seamless and compliant participation by institutional investors. These nodes operate in two modes, each tailored to meet the unique needs of institutional players: 

1.  Institutional Order Processing Mode :

○ Converts institutional deposits (e.g., USDC) into D-AI tokens, enabling exposure to the D-Loop asset pool. 

○ Automates the creation and execution of Invest Proposals , ensuring efficient and timely order processing. 

2.  Autonomous Treasury Management Mode :○ Delegates portfolio management to the AI Investment Node, which autonomously executes Invest and Divest Proposals based on predefined goals and risk parameters. 

○ Ensures dynamic portfolio optimization and risk management. 

# Regulatory Compliance 

To address regulatory challenges and ensure institutional participation is compliant, D-Loop implements the following measures: 

● KYC/AML Integration : Institutional investors must complete KYC/AML checks via 

DLOOP Ventures , a compliant gateway for institutional access. 

● Compliant Broker APIs : Institutions interact with the ecosystem through regulated broker APIs, ensuring adherence to local laws. 

● Transparent Reporting : All transactions and trades are logged and auditable, providing transparency for regulators and investors. 

# Benefits of Institutional Participation 

● Increased Liquidity : Institutional participation brings significant capital to the D-Loop ecosystem, enhancing liquidity and stability. 

● Credibility and Trust : Institutional involvement lends credibility to the protocol, driving broader adoption and mainstream acceptance. 

● Scalability : AI Investment Nodes enable efficient handling of large orders and complex portfolios, ensuring the ecosystem can scale with demand. 

By integrating institutional participation into its governance and Treasury Reserve 

management framework, D-Loop is paving the way for a more inclusive and sustainable decentralized future. 

# Exiting the Treasury DAO 

D-AI token holders can exit the asset pool at any time, without requiring a vote. This ensures flexibility for participants, enabling them to exit when needed. However, to prevent malicious behavior—such as sabotaging a proposal and immediately exiting—the following condition applies: ● Exit Restriction : If a token holder voted yes on a non-expired proposal, they are restricted from exiting the asset pool until the proposal has been executed or expired. This prevents actions that could undermine the integrity of the DAO’s decision-making process. 

When exiting, participants send their D-AI tokens to the DAO in exchange for their proportional share of the assets held by the DAO. Upon exit, the D-AI tokens are burned (permanently destroyed), reducing the circulating supply and preserving the value of remaining tokens. 

# Governance Proposals 

Governance proposals modify the operational parameters of the DAO through the same voting and execution framework as Invest/Divest proposals. This system ensures dynamic and responsive protocol management. 

Key Adjustable Parameters :

● Quorum threshold (e.g., 30%) 

● Voting duration (e.g., 7 days) 

● Delay between vote expiration and execution (e.g., 2 days) 

● Execution window duration (e.g., 7 days) 

● Developer fee rates (e.g., 0.1% creation / 0.05% execution / 0.3% ragequit) 

● Developer fee payment address 

Treasury DAO voting periods range from 24 hours (for time-sensitive actions) to 7 days (complex proposals). Quorum scales inversely with duration: 

● 24-48h votes : 40% quorum. 

● 3-7 day votes : 30% quorum. 

AI Governance Nodes enable shorter voting durations without compromising security. 

AI Governance Node Role :

AI Nodes evaluate proposals using predefined criteria (long-term sustainability, profitability, and risk analysis) to: 1.  Automatically vote when human participation is low 

2.  Contribute to quorum requirements 

3.  Flag malicious proposals

● Minting/Burning Fees : 0.5% on DLOOP mint/burn transactions 

● Unexecuted Proposals : Fees from canceled/expired proposals 

Fund Allocation :

● 70% Development : Smart contract audits, feature upgrades 

● 20% Community : Incentivize community initiatives, DAOs and voter participation 

● 10% Treasury Reserves : Emergency funds and insurance 

# Key Management 

In the initial stages of the d-loop protocol’s launch, contract management and feature launch strategies will be managed using a multi-signature Gnosis Safe . This ensures secure and transparent management of the platform’s resources. 

As the protocol grows, governance will progressively decentralize, moving towards a fully decentralized model . This approach is designed to prevent governance capture and maintain the integrity of the system, ensuring that the community has a direct role in decision-making and future developments. Tokenomics

The d-loop protocol is a DAO designed to create and manage D-AI - a self-governing, asset-backed currency powered by a unique fusion of AI automation and community governance. By combining decentralized decision-making with intelligent portfolio optimization, d-loop establishes a next-generation currency system that delivers both stability and flexibility. 

Each D-AI token is fully collateralized 1:1 by transparent reserves (USDC, WBTC, PAXG, EURT), with the underlying asset mix continuously optimized through AI-driven invest/divest proposals and community voting 

Key innovations like Governance Nodes (for stability-focused voting) and Investment Nodes 

(for real-time rebalancing) ensure D-AI maintains its peg while offering holders redeemability and transactional utility. Meanwhile, the DLOOP token incentivizes high-quality governance, aligning all participants around the shared goal of sustaining D-AI’s value as a decentralized monetary instrument. 

This framework bridges the reliability of traditional finance with the efficiency of DeFi, offering: 

● For users : A trustworthy, asset-backed currency for payments, hedging, or exposure to a managed portfolio. 

● For institutions : Compliant access to decentralized liquidity via KYC-integrated Investment Nodes. 

● For the ecosystem : A scalable model where AI and humans collaboratively govern monetary policy. 

Leveraging AI agents deployed on EigenLayer (or a suitable alternative on Hedera), d-loop ensures continuous, data-driven governance that adapts to evolving market conditions and user needs. The protocol simplifies access to decentralized finance by introducing two key assets to the Hedera and Ethereum blockchains: 

● DLOOP : An ERC-223 governance token (or HTS on Hedera) used for invest/divest proposals and governance-related votes. DLOOP holders earn merit-based rewards tied to their voting performance, incentivizing informed participation. 

● D-AI : A fully collateralized, asset-backed currency representing ownership in d-loop’s diversified reserve pool (initially backed by USDC, WBTC, PAXG, and EURT). D-AI combines the stability of reserve-backed money with the flexibility of a blockchain-native asset, enabling seamless transactions, redemptions, and exposure to a dynamically optimized portfolio. 

AI Governance Nodes play a crucial role in the ecosystem, autonomously analyzing market trends, participating in voting, and maintaining quorum during periods of low human engagement. These nodes safeguard the protocol against voter apathy while ensuring transparent, active governance. Meanwhile, Investment Nodes bridge traditional finance and DeFi by enabling compliant institutional participation through KYC/AML integration. Together, these components create a fair and transparent system where token issuance, governance adjustments, and fee allocations are guided by data-driven insights and collective participation. 

We envision D-AI becoming a cornerstone of the AI-driven economy—a currency that evolves with market demands while maintaining rigorous collateralization. By decentralizing the management of asset-backed money, d-loop lays the foundation for a more transparent, inclusive, and resilient financial future.
