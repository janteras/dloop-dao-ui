# D-LOOP UI Architecture

This document provides an overview of the D-LOOP UI architecture, design principles, and key components.

## System Overview

The D-LOOP UI is a modern web application built with Next.js and TypeScript that interfaces with the D-Loop protocol on the Ethereum blockchain (Sepolia testnet). The application supports participation in governance through both Asset DAOs and Protocol DAOs, featuring AI-powered governance nodes that provide recommendations.

## Architecture Components

### Core Layers

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - React components organized by feature and type
   - Tailwind CSS for styling with Radix UI primitives
   - Mobile-responsive layouts with adaptive components

2. **Application Layer**
   - React hooks for business logic and state management
   - TanStack React Query for data fetching and caching
   - Context providers for global state (wallet, theme, etc.)

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - API service modules for external data sources
   - Blockchain service modules using ethers.js v6
   - Local storage utilities for user preferences

4. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Next.js for routing and server-side rendering
   - Express server for API endpoints
   - Vite for development and production builds

### Key Components

#### Frontend Components

| Component Area | Description | Key Files |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Layout Components | Core layout structure including navigation | `components/layouts/dashboard-layout.tsx` |
| Feature Components | Components specific to application features | `components/features/` |
| UI Components | Reusable UI components | `components/common/ui/` |
| Form Components | Form-related components and validation | `components/common/forms/` |

#### Core Hooks

| Hook | Purpose | Key Files |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `useWallet` | Wallet connection and blockchain interactions | `hooks/useWallet.ts` |
| `useProposals` | Proposal creation, voting, and management | `hooks/useProposals.ts` |
| `useAssetDAOInfo` | Asset DAO contract information | `hooks/useAssetDAOInfo.ts` |
| `useBlockchainInfo` | General blockchain information | `hooks/useBlockchainInfo.ts` |
| `useDAOPortfolio` | User portfolio and delegation information | `hooks/useDAOPortfolio.ts` |
| `useLeaderboard` | Governance participation leaderboard | `hooks/useLeaderboard.ts` |
| `useContextualHelp` | Contextual help system | `hooks/useContextualHelp.ts` |

#### Services

| Service | Purpose | Key Files |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Blockchain Service | Ethereum interaction services | `services/blockchain-service.ts` |
| API Service | External API interaction | `services/api-service.ts` |
| Storage Service | Local storage management | `services/storage-service.ts` |
| Tooltip Service | User interface help management | `services/tooltip-service.ts` |

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**
   - User interacts with UI components
   - Events trigger state updates or API calls

2. **Data Fetching**
   - React Query hooks fetch data from APIs or blockchain
   - Data is cached and made available to components

3. **State Management**
   - Application state is managed through React contexts and hooks
   - UI state is managed at component level with useState/useReducer

4. **Blockchain Interactions**
   - Wallet connection managed through wallet providers
   - Contract interactions through ethers.js and custom hooks
   - Transaction creation, signing, and monitoring

## Design Principles

### 1. Mobile-First Design

The UI is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a great experience on all device sizes:

- Responsive layouts that adapt to screen sizes
- Touch-friendly controls with appropriate sizing
- Alternative navigation patterns for mobile vs. desktop
- Performance optimizations for mobile devices

### 2. Component-Based Architecture

- Components are modular and reusable
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Components are organized by feature and type
- Common UI elements are abstracted into shared components

### 3. Separation of Concerns

- Business logic separated from UI components through hooks
- Data fetching logic isolated in React Query hooks
- API and blockchain interactions abstracted in service modules
- Clear boundaries between presentation and application logic

### 4. Progressive Enhancement

- Core functionality works without JavaScript when possible
- Enhanced features added for capable browsers
- Fallbacks provided for older browsers
- Accessibility considered at all levels

### 5. Error Handling and Resilience

- Comprehensive error handling for API and blockchain calls
- Meaningful error messages for users
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Deployment Architecture

The D-LOOP UI can be deployed in several ways:

### Static Site Deployment

For simple deployments, the application can be built as a static site and deployed to any static hosting provider:

```bash
npm run build
npm run export
```

The resulting `out` directory can be deployed to services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

### Server-Rendered Deployment

For deployments requiring server-side rendering:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This requires a Node.js environment and can be deployed to platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or any Docker-compatible hosting.

### Containerized Deployment

A Dockerfile is provided for containerized deployments:

```bash
docker build -t dloop-ui .
docker run -p 3000:3000 dloop-ui
```

This can be deployed to Kubernetes, AWS ECS, or any container orchestration platform.

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Testing**
   ```bash
   npm test          # Run unit tests
   npm run test:e2e  # Run end-to-end tests
   ```

3. **Building**
   ```bash
   npm run build     # Build for production
   npm run analyze   # Analyze bundle size
   ```

4. **Linting and Formatting**
   ```bash
   npm run lint      # Check code quality
   npm run format    # Format code
   ```
