# AssetDAO End-to-End Investigation Summary

## ‚úÖ Working Correctly:
- Smart contract is accessible and responding
- Basic proposal fetching is functional  
- Contract has 85 proposals available

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found:
- Mixed data sources (API + contract) may cause inconsistency
- Multiple service abstraction layers increase error risk
- Token governance methods failing, using fallbacks
- Potential local storage usage needs audit

## üö® Critical Actions Needed:
1. Verify UnifiedProposalCard uses direct contract data
2. Audit all localStorage for voting state
3. Validate vote count accuracy against contract
4. Implement real-time event monitoring

## üìã Investigation Status:
- Contract ABI: ‚úÖ Analyzed
- Data flow: ‚úÖ Mapped  
- Local storage: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs audit
- Component integration: ‚ö†Ô∏è Verification needed
