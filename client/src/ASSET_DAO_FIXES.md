# AssetDAO Implementation - Fix Documentation

This document explains the changes made to fix the AssetDAO implementation issues and provides guidance on testing the implementation.

## Summary of Issues Fixed

1. **API Endpoint HTML Responses**: The Netlify functions were returning HTML instead of JSON, causing API fetch failures.
2. **CommonJS `require()` in Browser**: The `UnifiedProposalCard` component was using Node.js-style `require()` in browser context.
3. **Proposal Type Mapping Warnings**: Excessive console warnings when mapping proposal types.
4. **Token Display Issues**: Tokens were showing as 0x0000...0000 instead of proper symbols.
5. **Amount Display Bug**: Amounts were showing as 0.00 even when they had values.
6. **Proposal Type Bug**: All proposals were displayed as Investment Proposals.
7. **Missing Description**: Proposal descriptions were not displayed in the UI.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Vite Configuration for API Proxying

We've updated the Vite configuration to properly proxy Netlify function requests:

```typescript
// In vite.config.ts
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/.netlify/functions/': {
      target: 'http://localhost:9999', // Default Netlify Functions dev server
      changeOrigin: true,
      rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/\.netlify\/functions/, ''),
      configure: (proxy, _options) => {
        proxy.on('error', (err, _req, _res) => {
          console.log('Proxy error:', err);
        });
      },
    },
  },
},
```

### 2. Mock Data for Development

Created mock data to use during development when API endpoints are unavailable:

- Added mock protocol metrics and proposals in `src/mocks/api-mock-data.ts`
- Updated `api-utils.ts` to use these mocks for specific endpoints in development mode

### 3. Fixed ES Module Imports

Replaced CommonJS `require()` calls with proper ES Module imports in the `UnifiedProposalCard` component:

```typescript
// Before
const { getTokenSymbol, formatAmount, mapContractTypeToUI } = React.useMemo(() => {
  return require('@/utils/proposal-helpers');
}, []);

// After
import { getTokenSymbol as resolveTokenSymbol, formatAmount, mapContractTypeToUI } from '@/utils/proposal-helpers';
```

### 4. Enhanced Proposal Type Mapping

Improved the `mapContractTypeToUI` function in `proposal-helpers.ts` to:
- Handle string-based proposal types
- Better support for edge cases
- Reduced console warnings by only logging in development mode
- Fixed recursive mapping of string representation of numbers
- Added support for bigint values (common in Wagmi implementations)
- Implemented more robust handling of different type formats

### 5. Robust Token Symbol Resolution

Enhanced the `getTokenSymbol` function in `proposal-helpers.ts` to:
- Handle undefined and empty token addresses
- Implement case-insensitive matching for token addresses
- Add special handling for common testnet tokens
- Improve error handling with clear fallbacks
- Provide intelligent recognition of token addresses by name

### 6. Improved Amount Formatting

Enhanced the `formatAmount` function in `proposal-helpers.ts` to:
- Create a version-agnostic `safeFormatUnits` function that works across ethers versions
- Properly handle different numeric formats (bigint, number, string, hex)
- Add appropriate decimal places with locale-aware formatting
- Fix issues with amounts displaying as '0.00'

### 7. Centralized Mock Data Handling

Created a robust API utility (`api-utils.ts`) with:
- Centralized mock data access through a consistent interface
- Automatic environment detection (development vs. production)
- Intelligent caching mechanism to improve performance
- Graceful fallback to mock data during development

## Testing the Implementation

To verify all fixes are working correctly, follow this comprehensive testing plan:

### 1. Basic Functionality Testing

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   cd dloop-ui
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check API Responses**:
   - Open the browser console
   - Verify no errors for "Expected JSON response but got text/html"
   - You should see "Using mock proposals data" and "Using mock metrics data" logs in development mode

3. **Verify Proposal Card Rendering**:
   - Navigate to the AssetDAO section
   - Confirm the proposal cards are rendering without errors
   - Verify proposal types (invest/divest) are displayed correctly
   - Check that token symbols and amounts are showing properly
   - Ensure proposal descriptions are visible

### 2. Edge Case Testing

1. **Token Display Testing**:
   - Verify correct display of known tokens (DLOOP, USDC, WBTC, ETH)
   - Check handling of zero address tokens (should show as ETH)
   - Confirm unknown tokens show a shortened address format

2. **Amount Formatting Testing**:
   - Test with various amount formats: zero, very small, and very large values
   - Verify correct formatting of decimal places
   - Check handling of undefined/null amount values

3. **Proposal Type Testing**:
   - Confirm investment proposals show "Invest"
   - Confirm divestment proposals show "Divest"
   - Test with different proposal type representations (number, string, bigint)

### 3. Mock Data Transition Testing

1. **Development Mode**:
   - Verify the application uses mock data in development
   - Check correct fallback to mock data when API fails

2. **Production Simulation**:
   - Set `REACT_APP_USE_REAL_API=true` to force real API usage
   - Confirm the application attempts to use real endpoints
   - Verify graceful degradation when endpoints are unavailable

3. **Network Resilience**:
   - Test with slow network conditions
   - Verify API caching improves subsequent load times
   - Check that the UI remains responsive during API calls

4. **Test with Netlify Functions** (Optional):
   To test with actual Netlify Functions instead of mocks:
   ```bash
   # In a separate terminal
   cd dloop-ui
   netlify dev
   ```

## Mock Data Migration Plan

For a detailed plan on removing mock data dependencies, refer to the comprehensive migration document:

- `/docs/Mock_Data_Migration_Plan.md`

This document outlines the three-phase approach to transitioning from mock data to production-ready data fetching, including:

1. **Phase 1**: Centralize mock data access (completed)
2. **Phase 2**: Remove direct mock data references (in progress)
3. **Phase 3**: Implement production data sources (upcoming)

## Known Limitations

- The mock data provides a representative set of proposals but may not match the exact structure of production data
- The Vite proxy assumes Netlify Functions are running on port 9999, which may need adjustment
- Wagmi integration is still in progress as part of the unified Ethers-to-Wagmi migration pattern
- Token price fetching is mocked and would need real API integration in production

## Future Enhancements

1. **Complete Wagmi Migration**:
   - Finish migrating from ethers.js to wagmi for all blockchain interactions
   - Implement the unified contract access pattern consistently
   - Add telemetry to track migration progress and performance

2. **API Enhancements**:
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
   - Add runtime type validation for better error handling
   - Create API version management utilities
   - Implement more detailed error reporting
   - Add retry logic for transient failures

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement query deduplication for identical API requests
   - Add pagination for large data sets
   - Optimize rendering with React.memo and useMemo
   - Create more realistic mock data that matches production exactly
   - Add more edge cases for comprehensive testing
